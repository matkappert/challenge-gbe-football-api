### Great Big Events Developer Challenge

Your goal in this challenge is to utilise a free API to power a basic single page application (SPA) and host it using AWS’s Free Tier resources.
The SPA should leverage [RapidAPI’s API-Football](https://www.api-football.com/documentation) to display a list of all teams in the 2020-2021 English Premier League. The user should be able to select any two teams from the league and have the application show a comparison of the two team’s statistics.
The task should take you an evening to a day to complete.
Guidelines

- The SPA should be hosted on AWS, with the code available in a public git repository.
- The code should be clean and well commented.
- You may use any frontend framework, font, image or icon libraries that you are familiar with, however, the interface should be clean and intuitive to use across all devices and viewport sizes.
- The comparison may use any statistics you wish that are presented by the API.
  

Optionally, you may include any of the following features in your submission if you wish to demonstrate additional skillsets:

- DevOps/Infrastructure as code
- User sign-up and authentication
- CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery)
- A custom API that extends the data with your own or adds additional features to the SPA
  

Please send your submission to recruitment@greatbigevents.com including:

- A link to your hosted submission
- A link to any git repos included as part of the submission
- An optional 1-2 paragraphs explaining your submission and any additional features or elements you wish to highlight.
